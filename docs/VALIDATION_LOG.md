### Verification results

- `make up`: passed
- `docker compose exec -T backend alembic upgrade head`: passed
- `make health`: passed
- Mixed API workflow smoke: passed
- `make test`: passed (`77 passed`)
- `make lint`: passed
- `docker compose exec -T frontend npm run build`: passed; emitted existing ESLint flat-config warning while exiting 0
- `make frontend-health`: passed after frontend restart
- `make down`: passed
- Final `git status --short` after TA-W1-019 validation: clean

### Known issue / observation

Running the frontend production build inside the same Docker dev container/volume temporarily poisoned the Next dev cache and made the immediate frontend health check return HTTP 500. Restarting the frontend container and waiting for readiness restored `make frontend-health`. No product code change was required for TA-W1-019.
